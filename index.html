            <h2>Our Research</h2>
            <p style="color: #ccc; max-width: 800px; margin-bottom: 3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">For student athletes, CPR training isn’t just a precaution—it’s a vital skill that can save a teammate’s life. Promoting CPR awareness and preparedness in schools and sports programs is essential to protecting young lives on and off the field.</p>

                        <h3>Sudden Cardiac Arrest</h3>
                        <p>Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a life-threatening emergency that can strike even the healthiest individuals—including student athletes. Each year, approximately 100 to 150 young athletes experience SCA, and among NCAA athletes, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading medical cause of death, accounting for 13% of all athlete fatalities over a 20-year span.</p>

                        <h3>Risks</h3>
                        <p>Certain groups face even higher risks</p> 

<li>Male athletes are 4x more likely to experience SCD than females</li>

<li>Black athletes are 3x more likely than white athletes</li>

<li> Division I men’s basketball players face a 1 in 2,000 risk over a four-year career</li>

<p>Encouragingly, the incidence of SCD among NCAA athletes has decreased by 29% every five years, thanks to improved CPR training, wider access to AEDs, and better cardiovascular screening.</p>

                        <p>Immediate CPR can double or triple survival chances, but survival drops by 10% for every minute without intervention. Despite this, only 40% of cardiac arrest victims receive bystander CPR. When CPR is administered quickly, nearly 80% of survivors experience favorable neurological outcomes. </p>
